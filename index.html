              <h1>Describe the work environment or culture in which you are most productive and happy</h1>
                <p>
                We are in it together, we succeed together. Every individual is part of the team. When it’s time to pass the ball, you pass it. When you make the shot, or defend the goal, the rest of the team celebrates. When things go well, the work is praised. When others make the goal or defend it, you celebrate it. All of the team is proud of everyone’s efforts toward success. 
                </p><p>
                We are in it together, we grow together. When someone needs an assist, you are there to help. When you need an assist, the other team members support you. I want to work with a team that understands that we all win or lose together. When team members have bad news to share, you accept it with pragmatism and work together towards a solution. There is no pointing fingers. There is no blame, but we are clear and open about failures and work to learn from them.
              </p><p>
                We are in it together; We are a team. There is never the slightest hint of put downs or favoritism. There is never the slightest hint of jealousy. Each of us sees that we are on the same team, working towards the same goal of success. There is no job that is so mundane or tedious that it and those who do it are shunned; we all work together to the end. No one is put down or left in the dark. Everyone makes a difference. Everyone is proud of the work being done. Everyone is proud to be on the team. 
              </p><p>
                We are in it together.
              </p>
                <h1>What are two positive aspects of your current job or a previous position you have held?
                </h1><p>
                I have worked with some important tools that have had a lasting impact on the world. 
              </p><p>
                When I worked at AVEVA, I worked on SimSuite, which is a pipeline simulation product that modeled pipelines with telemetry and live SCADA data that our model engine then used to determine pipeline leaks quickly preventing both ecological damage and financial loss. I am proud to have been a part of such an important product that has had a real-world impact as the system has time and time again prevented large scale pipeline disasters. 
              </p><p>
                When I worked with UPS, I worked with the ORION system. ORION is a UPS system that determines package delivery routes. UPS estimates that using this system saves them large amounts of money, time, and gas as it determines the most efficient delivery schedules and routes based on real world ArcGIS data. These savings are at such a large scale that the product impacts us all.
              </p><p>
                We worked together as a team to solve complex problems. I remember the deep impact coworkers have had on my life and work. The times when they helped me with a problem, or the times when they asked for my help were always rewarding. I felt elevated when something I did had a positive impact on the team. Not when I received praise, but instead when my work showed clear value that helped the entire team’s path to success. 
              </p>
                <h1>What expectations do you have of senior leaders in an ideal workplace?
                </h1>
                Senior leaders lift. Senior leaders are the coaches that lead teams to victory. Senior leaders do not simply play their favorite position and pull the team along for the ride. Senior leaders distribute work, and don’t save special work for favored team members. Senior leaders are there to grow and encourage the whole team and find the most effective ways to put the team to work together. Senior leaders shouldn’t take it personally when problems happen, no matter how personal others might get. Senior leaders are pragmatic, and engaged. We are in it together. Senior leaders are examples of optimism. We are a great team; We will get this done. Senior leaders are a part of the team who will work together to get the job done. Senior leaders extend faith in their team, they know you are capable of more and they help you see your strengths. Senior leaders praise jobs well done at every turn and because of this, jobs well done are the standard. Senior leaders encourage growth and learning. Senior leaders act on the faith that team members will rise to challenges. Senior leaders lift.

                <h1>What does your ideal work day look like?
                </h1><p>
                The ideal day: Write some code, make sure it works, turn it in. The ideal day is a simple day where everything you do is straight forward and goes smoothly. The challenge of software development is almost always more complicated than that. We need to first understand what we are going to create or change. We need to anticipate the problems that might arise from the code, and mitigate them when we can. We need to accept issues we did not for see and fix them when they occur if not before then. The toughest problems stem from the fact that we are not writing code in a vacuum for our own private use, and we need to work well as a team to solve the complex problems that arise from users and their needs. I don’t expect work to be ideal, and I will embrace the hard work of understanding, documenting, testing and negotiating that surrounds the software development process in addition to the ideal parts of the day.
